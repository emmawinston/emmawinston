  <h1>üèïÔ∏è cowork.camp.club!!! üèïÔ∏è</h1>
  <h2>What's cowork.camp.club?</h2>
  <p>It's a...thing where campers team up on video chat (voice chat could work too, I think, and we have now also done it with text chat which is good for people with slow connections) and get stuff done. 'Stuff' can be whatever you want; as I'm writing this, four of us are co-working on (respectively) admin tasks, coding, writing, and fixing a broken modular synth.</p>

  <p>If two or more of us are on friend camp at the same time and feel like co-working, we log on to Discord, open a group DM and start video chat. We spend a few minutes telling each other what we're going to work on, then one of us starts a timer (I normally do 25 or 30 minutes, but you decide - we've been using http://itsalmo.st lately for shared timers). When the time's up, we share what we did, we WARMLY CONGRATULATE each other (important!), and then repeat the process as many times as we like.

  <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
  <p>Use the Discord link here to join: <a href="https://discord.gg/486CmUM">https://discord.gg/486CmUM</a></p>

  <p>I picked Discord because you don't have to install anything but honestly I hate how overwhelming the UI is, so if you have any other suggestions, please pass them on to me, or Darius, or someone else.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before you get started, make sure your microphone and/or camera are set up in your user settings (bottom left, gear icon).</li>

  <li>You need to add anyone you want to work with as a friend before you can video or voice call them: right-click them in the sidebar of the general channel, and click Add Friend.</li>

  <li>To make a video call, go to your Friends page (Home button on top left > Friends) and click 'New Group DM' on the top right (the speech bubble with a + sign).</li>

  <li>Add whoever you want to call and click Create Group DM.</li>

  <li>Click the camera icon (or phone icon if you want voice only chat) on the top right.</li>

  <li>Do the thing!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I work from home, I'm not always very good at being a person, I get way more done when I'm accountable to other people, and Darius and I do this sometimes and enjoy it. I figured it would be nice to have a way for campers to do it together.</p>

<p>(If you're not a member of friend camp, but have somehow found this page, consider this me quietly exhorting you to make one of these with your pals rather than using ours - I'd love it if this stayed friend camp-only, sort of like a group chat.)
