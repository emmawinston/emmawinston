Two exciting bits of news today: firstly, my first ever 7" single, ['Moon Maps'/'Hush Me'](https://wiaiwya.bandcamp.com/album/moon-maps-hush-me-2) is out (that link will take you to a page where you can download the songs or buy them on vinyl). Although I only started making electronic music last summer it feels like it's been a long time in the making, and I'm extremely proud of it. I will be playing a live gig tomorrow, Friday 7th April, supporting excellent friend and musician Darren Hayman, at the Shacklewell Arms in London, which you can get tickets for [here](http://www.wegottickets.com/event/351468) and which I'm really looking forward to.

Secondly, I'll be performing live from [Graphic Score Bot](https://emmawinston.me/graphicscorebot/) both at the V&A for [Bot Summit](http://tinysubversions.com/botsummit/2016/) on Saturday 8th April, and over a longer period of two days at Abandon Normal Devices Festival's ['The Art Of Bots' showcase](http://www.andfestival.org.uk/events/art-of-bots-showcase/) on the 15th and 16th of April.

It's been an extremely busy week which has slowed my research a little, but it feels like it's for a good reason. I'm so excited about my creative output as well as my academic work this year so far; long may it continue!
