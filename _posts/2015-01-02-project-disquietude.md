I contributed Python code to sound artists |end| and Annie Goh's installation, |dis|quiÉTUDE, which was shown at St James Hatcham Church in southeast London in April 2016. The code taps into Twitter streams which can be specified either by retweeted user or by specific search terms or hashtags, extracts numerical data from their associated follower counts, likes, and permalinks, and passes that data to Supercollider via the Open Sound Control protocol.
