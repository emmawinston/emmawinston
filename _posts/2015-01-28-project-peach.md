<a href="https://wiaiwya.bandcamp.com/album/peach"><i>Peach</i></a> is my first full-length album as Deerful, released on the label Where It's At Is Where You Are on the 2nd of June 2017. Written, recorded, produced and mixed in my front room, it traces a narrative of moments of contact between people, and above all celebrates the small moments that make up a life. Although mostly conventionally produced, it features a computerised vocalist on its opening track which was directed to 'sing' using Twitter API data. It was described by the Guardian as 'the most human record of the year'. My track-by-track exploration of the album is available at <a href="https://www.goldflakepaint.co.uk/album-stream-deerful-peach/">Gold Flake Paint</a>.</p>
