<a href="https://deerful.bandcamp.com/album/staying-still"><i>Staying Still</i></a> is an extremely personal EP. It was released on the DIY collective Gare Du Nord on 8th July 2016. Written in the summer of 2015, <i>Staying Still</i> is a record about stasis and feeling stuck, failed attempts at escape and at being heard, intrusive thoughts and stuffing them down. It can be purchased <a href="https://wiaiwya.bandcamp.com/album/moon-maps-hush-me-2">at my Bandcamp</a>.</p> Tracks from the EP have been played on <a href="www.bbc.co.uk/6music">BBC6 Music</a>.
