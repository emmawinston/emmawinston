<a href="https://deerful.bandcamp.com/album/staying-still"><i>Home</i></a>, released on Where It's At Is Where You Are on 14th October 2016, features two old songs, a new song, and a cover of the band the Mountain Goats, all arranged in the style of old-school video game music, or chiptune, and represents a homage to both the digital and analogue things that make you feel like you belong somewhere.</p>

<p>It was released alongside a platformer game for fantasy console PICO-8, which can be played <a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=27879">here</a>.</p>
