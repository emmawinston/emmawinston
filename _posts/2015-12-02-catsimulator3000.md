<h1 id="heading1">Cat Simulator 3000</h1>

<p>A hypertext adventure game built in the Twine engine, Cat Simulator 3000 was built in a weekend and was as much a creative writing experiment as a coding one. You play a cat who has to wreak as much havoc in your owner's house as possible before they get home.</p>

<p>Cat Simulator 3000 was named one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/12/12/best-free-games-of-the-week-7/">Rock Paper Shotgun's best free games of the week</a> in December 2015.

<p>You can play or download Cat Simulator 3000 <a href="http://deerful.itch.io/cat-simulator-3000">here</a>.
