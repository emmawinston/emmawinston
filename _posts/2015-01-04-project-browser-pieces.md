I engage with my web browser more than I do any other piece of electronic technology. I use it to consume research, to read, to listen to music, to view art. Until this project, I had never used it to create music.

Made and released on the evening of 26th January 2016, <i>Browser Pieces</i>  challenges my own use of the web browser as a consumption device. Using five in-browser synths created by independent developers, I recorded four tracks ranging from soft ambience to multilayered minimalism using only Google Chrome and Audacity for live capture.
