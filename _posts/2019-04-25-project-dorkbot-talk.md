[Dorkbot London](http://dorkbotlondon.org) is a meetup of artists 'doing strange things with electricity'. Alongside [Jem Finer](http://longplayer.org), [Sara Heitlinger](http://connectedseed.org), [Nicola Plant](http://nicolaplant.co.uk), and [Annie TÃ¥dne](http://tadne.se), I gave a talk about alienation from the tech industry, falling back in love with coding after accidentally making a live-coded album, what it means to *feel like a musician*, and comparing ixi as a 'toy language' to the ukulele's perception as a 'toy guitar'. Although this was very much a talk intended for a non-academic audience, it is my first piece of public engagement to fully draw together my PhD research with my creative practice.
