A brief note to say that I will be delivering a very personal, autoethnographic paper at 'S.E.E. Sound Education Experience', a Women In Sound/Women On Sound conference event which takes place at Goldsmiths, this Thursday 16th June. This is quite a different kind of public engagement from anything else I've previously done and I am very nervous but very excited. 

I will be talking about gender, neoliberalist resilience discourse, electronic pop and mental illness, all wrapped up in a fifteen-minute paper. There are lots of other wonderful things going on during the day ranging from synth-building workshops to installations and live performances, so I would urge you to come along for the whole day, if you are able.

Information about S.E.E. is available at [the Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1924693757757426/) or on the [Goldsmiths events page](http://www.gold.ac.uk/calendar/?id=9966).
