<p>I'm delighted to announce that I will be presenting a brand-new paper, <i>A Declaration Of Openness: intersectionality, idealism, and the politics of gentleness in early-stage research</i> during the first panel of the European Doctoral Seminar at Goldsmiths on the 25th of February, based loosely on my <a href="https://emmawinston.me/2016/01/25/lived-experience/">previous blog post here!</a></p>

<p>I'm absolutely delighted to have been asked to present at such an interesting event for my very first conference, and will try to record the process of preparing and presenting the paper as I go along.</p>
