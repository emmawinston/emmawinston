<h1 id="heading1">City Bells</h1>

<p>A self-released festive single, written and recorded by me, and co-produced jointly between myself and Darren Hayman. I wanted to become more used to working with digital distributors and publicising my own work without the help of a label behind me, and also wanted to see if I could make my first publicly-available music project financially sustainable. </p>

<p>The single was positively received by a number of small independent music bloggers, including For The Rabbits, Eardrums Pop and Christmas Underground, and was played by folk musician Chris T-T on his late-night Brighton radio show.
