<a href="https://deerful.bandcamp.com/album/staying-still">Without Borders</a> is a charity single by Deerful, released on 11th August 2016 in aid of independent legal organisation <a href="http://jcwi.org.uk">Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants</a>. Written after the referendum on the European Union, the A-side, 'European Summer', adopts a typically apolitical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillwave">chillwave</a> idiom musically, which serves as a deceptive backdrop for a political lyrical text. The B-side, coded in Supercollider, is my interpretation of <a href="http://www.squarepusher.net/midi-sans-frontieres/index.html">Squarepusher's MIDI Sans Fronti√®res</a> project. All proceeds continue to be donated to JCWI.</p>
