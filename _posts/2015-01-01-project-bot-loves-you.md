Now sadly defunct, <a href="http://twitter.com/botlovesyou">Bot Loves You</a> was the first bot I ever created, written in Ruby and running on Heroku. Bot Loves You tweets emoji hearts a few times daily, and also responds to mentions. Despite its limited vocabulary and lack of intelligence, Bot Loves You is intended to make users feel fond of it, and holds semi-regular 'conversations' initiated by its followers.
