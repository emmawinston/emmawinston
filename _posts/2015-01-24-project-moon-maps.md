<a href="https://wiaiwya.bandcamp.com/album/moon-maps-hush-me-2">'Moon Maps'/'Hush Me'</a> is my solo first vinyl release as <a href="https://deerful.com">Deerful</a>, and was released on <a href="http://www.wiaiwya.com/">Where It's At Is Where You Are Records</a> on the 7th of April 2016. Written in the summer of 2015, it represents some of my first steps into electronic music, and ranges from upbeat synthpop to unsettling ambience. It can be purchased <a href="https://wiaiwya.bandcamp.com/album/moon-maps-hush-me-2">at WIAIWYA's Bandcamp</a>. 

Moon Maps has been played on <a href="www.bbc.co.uk/6music">BBC6 Music</a>, and <a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/Beyond.Synth.Podcast/">Beyond Synth's popular synthwave podcast.
