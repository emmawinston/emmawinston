Happy New Year! A quick update, in between working on my thesis, to say that my ixi lang installation guide has now been updated to work with newer versions of SuperCollider in both OS X and Windows. A giant shout-out to Lucy of Heavy Lifting for the new SuperCollider classes.


[You can find it here](https://emmawinston.me/2018/07/18/installing-ixi-lang/); as always, do get in touch with me if you have any questions, and I'll do my best to help out.
