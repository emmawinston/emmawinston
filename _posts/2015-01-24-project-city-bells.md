<a href="http://deerful.band/album/city-bells">City Bells</a> is a festive single, self-released on the 15th of December 2015, written and recorded by me as <a href="https://deerful.com">Deerful</a>, and co-produced jointly between myself and Darren Hayman. I wanted to become more used to working with digital distributors and publicising my own work without the help of a label behind me, and also wanted to see if I could make my first publicly-available music project financially sustainable. </p>
