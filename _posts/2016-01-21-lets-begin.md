<p>Hello! I'm Emma Winston, a PhD student at Goldsmiths, University of London, and this is my first post.</p>

<p>I don't expect this to be an especially active or frequently-updated blog, but I do intend to use it for the more interesting aspects and snippets of news related to my research, and I hope it will both be an interesting read and make me more accountable to my own work. In essence, I am studying ukulele players and groups, with a particular focus on identity and creative expression; it's as interesting as it sounds, and a lot less silly!</p>

<p>My PhD has seen a slow start; I was very unwell for most of 2015, but attempted to plough on as a full-time student come September anyway, which turned out to be a terrible mistake. After a two-month sabbatical, during which I eased myself back into teaching, creative work, and research, I'm now much healthier, properly treated and on good medication, and am excitedly getting on with my literature review.</p> 

<p>I'm especially looking forward to beginning my group-based fieldwork, which will, I suspect, form the absolute core of my research. I expect to spend the next few weeks buried in books, but I hope to be talking to, and playing alongside, ukulele players themselves as soon as possible.</p>
