<p>In the spirit of NaNoWriMo, National Novel Generation Month encourages participants to write code which generates a 50,000 word novel. During November 2018, I submitted my first entry to NaNoGenMo. <i>Boring Tales From Tiny Places</i> takes as its source an emoji landscape, identifies the characters displayed in it, and uses the RiTa text generation library to construct a narrative around them. Dialogue is made up of Markov-chained text from genre-appropriate sources.</p>
