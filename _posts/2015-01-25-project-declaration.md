As researchers, how do we conduct identity-focused fieldwork in a way that is helpful, and not harmful, to the people whose experiences we are researching? This paper draws upon a range of disciplines from feminist theory to theology to explore 'gentleness' as a mode of interaction within research, calling into question traditional ethnography and focusing upon the emotions of both researcher and participant as a point of contact.
