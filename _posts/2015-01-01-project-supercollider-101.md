I received a full scholarship to attend Stanford University's week-long SuperCollider Summer Workshop in June 2016 under their Women In Computer Music scheme. Over the course of the week I developed a chord-sequence generator, as well as multiple sound pieces including the instrumental which would become the b-side to my single <i>Without Borders</i>. 

I have since experimented with live-coding music in ChucK, ixi lang, tidalCycles and Gibber, and am currently releasing a series of songs coded in ixi lang on YouTube and Patreon. My songwriting progress in ixi lang is <a href="https://github.com/emmawinston/ixilang-experiments">published to Github</a>.
