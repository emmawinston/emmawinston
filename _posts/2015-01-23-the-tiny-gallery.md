<a href="http://twitter.com/thetinygallery">The Tiny Gallery</a> is by far my most popular Twitter bot to date. The Tiny Gallery posts a few tiny exhibits each day, complete with equally tiny visitors. A <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/410496/emoji-becomes-art-in-tiny-gallery-on-twitter/">profile of the Tiny Gallery</a> was featured on tech and culture website Cult of Mac one day after its launch.
