A simple web app inspired by poems I had seen on Instagram, in which a pre-existent page of text is crossed out and edited with a black marker pen, the [Blackout Poetry Maker](https://blackoutpoetry.glitch.me/) provides a way to experiment with the form in a digital context. With the exception of the HTML2Canvas library, the app is written in vanilla JavaScript. It was featured by [Glitch](http://glitch.me) shortly after its release.
