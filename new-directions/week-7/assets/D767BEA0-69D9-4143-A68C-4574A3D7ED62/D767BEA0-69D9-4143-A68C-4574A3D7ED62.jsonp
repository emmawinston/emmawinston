An important question here is that the DIY artist is also his audience, and his audience knows that they could also be on the stage.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":913.653,"height":401.3999998569489}},{"text":"—Rheia, n.p.","targetRectangle":{"y":468.6968748569489,"x":57,"width":163.6755,"height":50.39999985694885}},{"text":"Do you agree that the internet has reshaped the meaning of DIY?","targetRectangle":{"y":569.4968745708466,"x":87.53571331501007,"width":877.1445000000003,"height":50.39999985694885}},{"text":"Is there a difference between DIY and independent?
