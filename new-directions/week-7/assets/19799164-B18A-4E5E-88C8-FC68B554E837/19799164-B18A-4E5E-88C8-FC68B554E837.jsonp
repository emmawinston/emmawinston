There is thus a kind of paradox to individually produced and circulated content of live music events, which represent a point of convergence between the highest and lowest levels of media authenticity. By sharing live concert footage online, the YouTube users in our study are circulating DIY content to a massive audience, rendering instantly reproducible a singularly unique artistic event and effectively collapsing both ends of the uniqueness hierarchy.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":915.2514,"height":451.7600002288818}},{"text":"—Lingel and Naaman, p. 344","targetRectangle":{"y":519.0568752288818,"x":75,"width":384.5226000000001,"height":51.76000022888184}},{"text":"What do you think of Sinnreich’s hierarchy?","targetRectangle":{"y":570.8168754577637,"x":88.50000063351217,"width":594.0270000000002,"height":51.76000022888184}},{"text":"Do you agree that live concert footage subverts that hierarchy?","targetRectangle":{"y":622.5768756866455,"x":88.50000063351217,"width":875.5319999999999,"height":40}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"FB24C0973A44EB4D5D0FD4CA0E4ECE4F"}]}]}}]}} )
