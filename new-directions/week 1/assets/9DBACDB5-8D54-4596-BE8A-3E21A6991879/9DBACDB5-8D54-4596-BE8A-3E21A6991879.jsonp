As in musicology, this may entail a kind of entrancement by the musical object; but it also occurs when music acts for the ethnomusicologist as a synecdoche for a romanticized conception of the ‘people’, against any assumption of their cultural or musical inferiority. In contrast…anthropologists, despite adhering on occasion to a similarly romanticized understanding of non- Western peoples, are commonly not led to idealize their subjects since ethnographic fieldwork invariably demands that they confront the full spectrum of human behaviour, from the redemptive, creative and beautiful to the cruel, authoritarian and ugly.
