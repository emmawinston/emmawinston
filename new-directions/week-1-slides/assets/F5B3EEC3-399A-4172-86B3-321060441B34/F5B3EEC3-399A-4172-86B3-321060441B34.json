The first boundary concerns what music is: it rests on the ontological assumption that ‘music’s’ core being has nothing to do with the ‘social’ (a conceptual equation in which the ‘cultural’ is often seen as a mediating or even substitute term for the social). According to this conceptual dualism, the ‘social’ is extraneous to ‘music’, and equivalent to ‘context’, such that the appropriate focus in music scholarship is self-evidently on the ‘music itself’.  The second boundary concerns what counts as music to be studied.
