No student of historical musicology could ever graduate without having at least a basic proficiency in music theory and analysis, ear training and piano performance, a pedagogical convention that directly results in the perplexing kinds of melodic, rhythmic and harmonic analyses Tagg notes comprise the bulk of popular music analysis. I argue that an equivalent baseline for popular music studies would include the ability to understand recorded music theory and analysis, ear training skills geared towards hearing production techniques (also called “reverse-engineering” the recording process), and a basic practical knowledge of how recording work, studio musicianship and production/arrangement is done.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":915.8865,"height":405.4800002574921}},{"text":"—Bates, p.18","targetRectangle":{"y":472.7768752574921,"x":57,"width":142.674,"height":42.48000025749207}},{"text":"Why do you think Bates considers these skills necessary?
