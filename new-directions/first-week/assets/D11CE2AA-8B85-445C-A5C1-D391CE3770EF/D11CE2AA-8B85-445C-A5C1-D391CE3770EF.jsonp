This points to the hierarchical division of labour that characterizes many examples of interdisciplinary practice, an arrangement that may favour the stability of component disciplines and inhibit epistemic change. In this mode the service discipline(s) are usually understood to be filling in for an absence or lack in the other, (master) discipline(s)…In the third, agonistic-antagonistic, mode, in contrast, interdisciplinary research is conceived neither as a synthesis nor in terms of a disciplinary division of labour, but as driven by an agonistic or antagonistic relation to existing forms of disciplinary knowledge and practice. Here, interdisciplinarity springs from a self-conscious dialogue with, criticism of, or opposition to, the intellectual, aesthetic, ethical or political limits of established disciplines.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":912.4815,"height":395.1600000858307}},{"text":"—Born, pp. 210-211.","targetRectangle":{"y":462.4568750858307,"x":75,"width":202.3150000000001,"height":35.16000008583069}},{"text":"What purpose might each of these modes of interdisciplinarity serve?","targetRectangle":{"y":532.7768752574921,"x":110.0357135534286,"width":663.6404999999995,"height":35.16000008583069}},{"text":"Do you agree with Born that the agonistic-antagonistic mode is the best to break new ground in popular music research?
