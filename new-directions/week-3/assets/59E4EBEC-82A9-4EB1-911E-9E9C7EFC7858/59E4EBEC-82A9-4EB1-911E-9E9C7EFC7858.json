Some pathways are narrow, highly individual and particularistic, whilst others are wider, well-trodden and more familiar. Moreover, people can forge new and innovative paths whilst also maintaining paths that are older, established and traditional. These musical pathways are just some of the many pathways in people’s lives, and they can be left and rejoined.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":75,"width":898.2738000000001,"height":372.7200000286102}},{"text":"By describing music-making and music genres in terms of ‘pathways’ rather than ‘worlds’, Finnegan thus adopts a metaphor that is more open and dynamic, and more suited to the flux and flow of local music-making.
