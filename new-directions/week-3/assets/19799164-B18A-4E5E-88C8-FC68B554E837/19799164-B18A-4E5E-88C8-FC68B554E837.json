But whilst numerous forms of music may achieve this, from folk to pop (as in Stokes’ analysis), Grime realises this in a specific manner. Consequently, as a data resource, many recordings which fall under the generic tag of Grime represent a series of ‘documents’ that convey the historical, social and cultural moment in which the music was produced. This is because (albeit without any premeditated ethnographic agenda) Grime constitutes a collective body of music which is centrally about the mapping of distinctive socio-economic spatial and cultural configurations. The tracks produced by Grime performers consistently reflect specific modes of living and particular social conditions, frequently experienced by performers themselves.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":909.09,"height":418.0799996852875}},{"text":"—Barron, p. 23","targetRectangle":{"y":485.3768746852875,"x":75,"width":170.8308,"height":44.07999968528748}},{"text":"How does grime map space and place?
