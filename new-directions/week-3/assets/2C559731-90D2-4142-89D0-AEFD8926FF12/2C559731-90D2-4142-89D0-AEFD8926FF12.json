Interviews with musicians showed the valuing of such music to be closely associated with particular offline venues and certain trendy, gentrifying parts of London. Statistical analysis of information scraped from user profiles on the SoundCloud website, meanwhile, showed a number of privileged cities to benefit from the public valuing activity of users in other cities. We found that, despite the apparent “placelessness” of the internet, expressions of esteem on SoundCloud appear to circulate primarily (a) within cities, (b) between cities located within the same region, and (c) towards a particular set of cities with large cultural economies and a strong association with electronic dance music. This may be in part because of a special association between electronic dance music and the often highly localised scenes within and by reference to which it is produced and valued.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":911.5092,"height":452.0799996852875}},{"text":"—Allington et al, p. 219","targetRectangle":{"y":519.3768746852875,"x":75,"width":268.3295999999999,"height":44.07999968528748}},{"text":"In your experience, is the importance of place consistent in types of music other than EDM?
