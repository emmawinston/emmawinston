Whilst the Xavante appear to have been treated with respect and receive royalties, it is unclear how they under- stood the project and what they will get out of it. The Xavante had little say on how the piece was set within the album (although 'Itsari' was not overdubbed at all). Neither can Sepultura ensure that those who purchase their albums will not exoticise the Brazilianness in the project. Nonetheless, Sepultura did approach Roots in a spirit of discovery that avoids many of the pitfalls that other artists have fallen into in such projects. The collaboration was not intended simply to add exotic 'colour' to their music, but was a sincere (if perhaps naive) attempt to collaborate and learn from Sepultura's fellow Brazilians. Moreover, the Xavante of Pimentel Barbosa have become skilled at dealing with non-Xavante Brazilians and non-Brazilians and Cipasse, the president of the Xavante of Pimentel Barbosa and Sepultura's primary contact, had toured with Milton Nascimiento. The Xavante also released a statement warmly commending the collaboration.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":912.2220000000001,"height":471.7200000286102}},{"text":"â€”Harris, pp. 22-23","targetRectangle":{"y":539.0168750286102,"x":75,"width":205.6265999999999,"height":42.72000002861023}},{"text":"What, in your opinion, is the most ethical approach to cultural borrowing in musical works?
