The decline in live venues in Sydney is also demand-driven. Shifting demographics have dwindled away the fan base supporting live music. Those who saw live music at its height in the 1980s and early 1990s have grown older and are less likely to see music themselves for a number of reasons, including a shift in the balance in their lives between work and leisure. At the same time, younger generations have a much wider range of competing entertainment forms. Most, if not all, of these factors are beyond the ambit of one Council’s strategies for live music concerts in public spaces. As state and federal governments remain dominant in the raising of taxation revenues and subsequent allocation of cultural finances, the local tier cannot entertain the provision of council-funded venues, as is the case in Europe.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":915.7199999999998,"height":467.759999871254}},{"text":"—Gibson and Homan, pp. 80-81","targetRectangle":{"y":535.056874871254,"x":75,"width":349.896,"height":38.75999987125397}},{"text":"Do you agree that these are the main factors in the decline of live venues?","targetRectangle":{"y":612.5768746137619,"x":112.7142848968506,"width":837.4319999999997,"height":38.75999987125397}},{"text":"What alternative solutions might exist?","targetRectangle":{"y":651.3368744850159,"x":112.7142848968506,"width":439.2000000000002,"height":33}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"843965B2B6B9FACF1E738B7DD6D901DC"}]}]}}]}
