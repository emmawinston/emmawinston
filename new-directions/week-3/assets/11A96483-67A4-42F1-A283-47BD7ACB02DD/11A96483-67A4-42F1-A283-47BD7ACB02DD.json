Because it primarily exists in order to facilitate dancing and related forms of sociality, its consumption is closely tied to particular kinds of venues, especially the club, which typically builds its clientele by playing a specific genre or sub-genre capable of drawing a crowd in its particular locale. Moreover, while the international stars of electronic dance music genres generate income…by releasing heavily promoted albums, touring, and headlining festivals, and are for that reason geographically footloose, most producers can only monetise their art through regular DJing, with a “residency” at a single club generally being the most efficient way in which to achieve this. In consequence, electronic dance music genres are characterised by a particularly strong association between producers, consumers, and places (exemplified by the Chicago house scene, which began with Frankie Knuckles’s famous residency at the Warehouse gay club). The association with place means that the potential for the development of such genres is severely restricted without appropriate venues, as evidenced by the difficulties several of our interviewees faced before their entrance into the (East) London scene. Thus, decentralisation of the production of electronic dance music tracks may have less geographical impact than might be supposed upon the production of their value.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":915.8574000000001,"height":472.5199997425079}},{"text":"—Allington et al, p. 215","targetRectangle":{"y":539.8168747425079,"x":75,"width":226.8024,"height":37.51999974250793}},{"text":"Do you agree that ‘placelessness’ is a luxury afforded only to the best-known producers?","targetRectangle":{"y":614.8568742275238,"x":79.82142702851979,"width":886.6551000000001,"height":37.51999974250793}},{"text":"Is music always tied to a place of some kind, or are there exceptions?","targetRectangle":{"y":652.3768739700317,"x":79.82142702851979,"width":691.8453000000001,"height":29}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"C7B04D7E1393D42F0589D8E8D10DDB99"}]}]}}]}
