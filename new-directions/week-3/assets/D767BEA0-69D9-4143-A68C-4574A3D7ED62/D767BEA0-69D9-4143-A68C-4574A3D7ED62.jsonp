This assertion allows us to avoid the endless task of drawing boundaries between what is a scene and what is not. It recognises that no musical practice can take place entirely separately from social processes. The implication is that scenes include everything, from tight-knit local musical communities to isolated musicians and occasional fans, since all contribute to and feed off a larger space(s) of musical practice. Even the simple action of buying a CD means to become 'involved' in a scene, in however slight a way, by virtue of causing some sort of effect within it. One cannot make a rigid distinction between 'active' and 'passive' membership. It also follows that everything within a scene, and indeed scenes themselves, may exist within a number of other scenes. A musical text, for example, may circulate within a number of scenes at once. Moreover…scenes themselves are constantly shifting, splitting and combining - any stability can only be momentary.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":916.3772999999999,"height":471.7200000286102}},{"text":"—Harris, p.25","targetRectangle":{"y":539.0168750286102,"x":75,"width":148.9104,"height":42.72000002861023}},{"text":"Do you agree that all music takes place within scenes?","targetRectangle":{"y":581.7368750572205,"x":83.03571264062612,"width":617.9247000000003,"height":42.72000002861023}},{"text":"What is the difference between scene and subculture (you may want to look earlier in this paper to see Harris’s view)?","targetRectangle":{"y":624.4568750858307,"x":83.03571264062612,"width":872.5401000000002,"height":66}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"61ABDF9E2BBF9EC2BFAC75D05BE58855"}]}]}}]}} )
