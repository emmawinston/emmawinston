That anomaly can be partly explained through deconstruction of the absolute music aesthetic and through a critical examination of music education’s lopsided concern for poiesis at the expense of aesthesis. But the anomaly is also caused by the simple fact, obvious to the point of tautology, that, in a scopocentric culture…visible music draws much more attention to itself.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":914.8643999999999,"height":429.2799999713898}},{"text":"—Tagg, pp. 17-18","targetRectangle":{"y":496.5768749713898,"x":75,"width":228.279,"height":49.27999997138977}},{"text":"What do you think of Tagg’s division of ‘visible’ and ‘invisible’ music?","targetRectangle":{"y":545.8568749427795,"x":87.21428557123454,"width":820.2533999999999,"height":87.27999997138977}},{"text":"Is any of the music you research yourself invisible?","targetRectangle":{"y":633.1368749141693,"x":87.21428557123454,"width":662.7845999999997,"height":38}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"7C7258009750BEDE15C9A27539237C7E"}]}]}}]}} )
