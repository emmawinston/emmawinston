In their 2002 book Soundtracks: Popular Music, Identity and Place, John Connell and Chris Gibson claim that the spread of the internet has increased the flow of subcultural music and information across disparate localities, thus helping to “de-link the notion of scene from locality” (107), and that, for those involved in little-known music genres, the internet enables a sense of offline “imagined community” that is crucial to scenes but not tied to geography. Even as some local spaces survive, the internet has likely accelerated the process of regional, national, and international sounds and practices interacting with local music (279). Increasingly, it is argued, geography doesn’t matter, thanks to the internet’s ability to facilitate “virtual scenes.” Andy Bennett and Richard Peterson contrast virtual scenes with conventional local music scenes, which feature live offline events like concerts. Virtual scenes are comprised of mediated one-to-one communication, largely between fans, which, they argue, makes the virtual scene one much more of the fans’ making (11).","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":914.9064000000001,"height":398.8800001144409}},{"text":"—Kruse, p.631","targetRectangle":{"y":466.1768751144409,"x":57,"width":146.8086,"height":38.88000011444092}},{"text":"Do you agree that the structures of online and offline fan communities are fundamentally different?
