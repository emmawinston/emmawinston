The interviews lasted between 15 and 90 minutes, and were conducted by phone or with software such as Skype, Google Chat, and Microsoft Messenger. Each was conducted in real time, either with audio or, when the participant preferred, video recording; the audio of each interview was recorded for transcription purposes. Three interviews were conducted in Korean and later translated into English. The remainder was conducted in English.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":911.0399999999997,"height":302.759999871254}},{"text":"In the interviews with fans, participants were asked a range of questions, including what it meant to self-identify as a Little Monster, how they felt about Lady Gaga, how social media impacted their interest in and relationship to Lady Gaga, and their feelings about Lady Gaga’s social activism.
