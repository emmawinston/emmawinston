Similarly, Jeffrey Kassing and Jimmy Sanderson argue that celebrity and fan online interactions not only demonstrate, but, more importantly, transform parasocial relationships (185). Although online relationships and conversations between celebrities and fans remain mediated, fans increasingly experience them as real and authentic, reinforcing their feelings of truly “knowing” celebrities. Celebrities’ reciprocity gives the illusion of two-way communication, which deepens fan-celebrity relationships in ways not possible through traditional media forms (Corrigan).","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":75,"width":898.5599999999999,"height":450.4800002574921}},{"text":"—Click et al, p. 366.","targetRectangle":{"y":517.7768752574921,"x":93,"width":243.54,"height":43.48000025749207}},{"text":"Is this communication always illusory?","targetRectangle":{"y":604.7368757724762,"x":115.9285725525447,"width":451.116,"height":43.48000025749207}},{"text":"How does this work in the context of microfame?","targetRectangle":{"y":648.2168760299683,"x":115.9285725525447,"width":588.0060000000001,"height":37}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"8EC3773686B0CA7EF9E0C6716601F121"}]}]}}]}} )
