For the purposes of this work, I am using a strategy to describe an official activity, much like the ones taken by recording labels, that occurs as ‘a victory of space over time’ such that it is a long-term activity (xix). In defining the counterpoint, I look to de Certeau’s definition of a tactic as ‘a calculus which cannot count on a “proper” (a spatial or institutional localization)’ (xix). Tactics are activities done by the ‘weak’ in a place that ‘belongs to the other.’ In her study on R.E.M. and their fans, Bennett (2011) found that the band deployed strategies while the fans responded with tactics; there, it is clearly a case of hierarchy and power...Specifically, I am examining various strategies and tactics of each, arguing that Palmer deploys tactics when she is trying to interact with fans to accomplish minor projects and deploys strategies when trying to work on projects that are more robust. Such robust projects include supporting record production, while more minor projects include t-shirt sales and video production.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.296875,"x":57,"width":912.1496999999999,"height":443.2399997711182}},{"text":"—Potts, p.363","targetRectangle":{"y":510.5368747711182,"x":75,"width":147.147,"height":40.23999977111816}},{"text":"What makes a strategy and what makes a tactic?","targetRectangle":{"y":591.0168743133545,"x":81.74999757834848,"width":497.9667000000001,"height":40.23999977111816}},{"text":"What makes a project more or less ‘robust’?","targetRectangle":{"y":631.2568740844727,"x":81.74999757834848,"width":450.4730999999999,"height":40.23999977111816}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"F5FE6F660D786EE5578C380CC8B60730"}]}]}}]}
