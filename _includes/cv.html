EDUCATION

Graduate Student, MPhil/PhD
Goldsmiths, University of London2015 to present
I am a graduate student in the Music department at Goldsmiths University of London. My doctoral research is centred around articulations of marginalised identity amongst ukulele players, both alone and in a group/community context, and will draw particularly from intersectional theory, taking into account overlapping issues of identity including gender, race, class, sexuality and dis/ability. My research is funded by the CHASE consortium.
