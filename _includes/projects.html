			<i class="fas fa-file-audio"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Live-coded music - ongoing</strong>

			<p>I received a full scholarship to attend Stanford University's week-long SuperCollider Summer Workshop in June 2016 under their Women In Computer Music scheme. Over the course of the week I developed a chord-sequence generator, as well as multiple sound pieces including the instrumental which would become the b-side to my single <i>Without Borders</i>. </p>

			<p>I have since experimented with live-coding music in ChucK and ixi lang, and am currently releasing a series of songs coded in ixi lang on YouTube and Patreon. My songwriting progress in ixi lang is <a href="https://github.com/emmawinston/ixilang-experiments">published to Github</a>.</p>

			<i class="fas fa-music"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://wiaiwya.bandcamp.com/album/peach">Deerful: Peach</a> (EP, WIAIWYA) - 2 June 2017</strong>

			<p><i>Peach</i> is my first full-length album. Written, recorded, produced and mixed in my front room, it traces a narrative of moments of contact between people, and above all celebrates the small moments that make up a life. Although mostly conventionally produced, it features a computerised vocalist on its opening track which was directed to 'sing' using Twitter API data. It was described by the Guardian as 'the most human record of the year'. My track-by-track exploration of the album is available at <a href="https://www.goldflakepaint.co.uk/album-stream-deerful-peach/">Gold Flake Paint</a>.</p>

			<p>Without Borders is a charity single released in aid of independent legal organisation <a href="http://jcwi.org.uk">Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants</a>. Written after the referendum on the European Union, the A-side, 'European Summer', adopts a typically apolitical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillwave">chillwave</a> idiom musically, which serves as a deceptive backdrop for a political lyrical text. The B-side, coded in Supercollider, is my interpretation of <a href="http://www.squarepusher.net/midi-sans-frontieres/index.html">Squarepusher's MIDI Sans Fronti√®res</a> project. All proceeds continue to be donated to JCWI.</p>

			<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://twitter.com/graphicscorebot">Graphic Score Bot</a> - ongoing (<a href="https://emmawinston.me/graphicscorebot/">more about this</a>)</strong>

			<p>An art project using the Twitter platform to post hourly generative graphic scores. <a href="https://emmawinston.me/graphicscorebot/">More fully explained here</a>, the bot is designed as a jumping-off point rather than being prescriptive or instructive, and generates score-like images (and occasional extracts from Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies) which can be interpreted by anyone, regardless of musical experience.</p>

			<p>Users are free to take into account or ignore everything from shape, colour, opacity, and position on 'stave' (or, occasionally, lack thereof) in their interpretations of what the bot posts. I plan to manually retweet any creations based on the generated scores that are sent to me, and also intend to add more features to the bot in the future.</p>

			<p>Graphic Score Bot is a superficial attempt to make sense of my own complicated feelings about sound art and experimental music, which I view as simultaneously more and less accessible to listeners and artists without a 'conventional' musical background. Despite the fact that experimental music can be played and created with no knowledge or understanding of Western art music whatsoever, the fact remains that the culture surrounding it is often intimidating. I wondered if I could take some of the self-consciousness out of composition by imposing limitations which are generated beyond my control, other than the parameters I feed into the bot in the first place (which I am well aware is another layer of complexity in play - although the meanings of these may equally change at the point of reception). Graphic Score Bot both limits the field of creativity and expands it infinitely, depending upon how it is interpreted.</p> 

			<p>A live variation of Graphic Score Bot was performed from at <a href="http://tinysubversions.com/botsummit/2016/">BotSummit 2016</a> at the Victoria and Albert museum, and later, in a more developed real-time form at Abandon Normal Devices' festival <a href="http://www.andfestival.org.uk/events/art-of-bots-showcase/">The Art of Bots</a> at Somerset House in London.

			<i class="fas fa-file-audio"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://citiesandmemory.com/dadasounds/">Ssa-ha-la - Cities and Memory: Dada Sounds</a> (sound art) - 5th February 2016</strong>

			<p>Cities and Memory is a global field recording &amp; sound art work that presents both the present reality of a place, but also its imagined, alternative counterpart ‚Äì remixing the world, one sound at at time. The Dada Sounds project marks a century of Dadaism by applying the techniques and practices of Dada to field recordings from around the world, bringing a Dadaist approach to the concepts of sound, place and memory.</p>

			<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1336284631/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=4223775533/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://citiesandmemory.bandcamp.com/album/dada-sounds">Dada Sounds by Emma Winston</a></iframe>

			<p>For my work, 'Ssa-ha-la', I chose to use an existing sound from the Cities and Memory database, since I felt this was more in keeping with the spirit of the Dada readymade than procuring my own field recording would have been (although I ultimately manipulated the recording far more than perhaps Marcel Duchamp would have approved of!). Listening closely to the sound of the waves and seagulls at low tide, I decided to write a sound poem, in the 'Bruitist' (or phonetic) form invented by Dadaist Richard Huelsenbeck, which would reflect and exaggerate the natural sounds accompanying it, replacing semantic logic with sonic logic. The result is a kind of 'sound song' which intertwines with the cries of the gulls and sibilant waves.</p>

			<p>'SSa-ha-la' appears on Cities and Memory's Dada Sounds highlights compilation, available as a pay-what-you-want download <a href="https://citiesandmemory.bandcamp.com/album/dada-sounds">here</a>.</p>

			<p>I engage with my web browser more than I do any other piece of electronic technology. I use it to consume research, to read, to listen to music, to view art. Until now, I had never used it to create.</p>

			<p>A series of small bots, quickly made, using the Twitter platform to post automated humorous or artistic content. The bots fall into two categories; the first run on the <a href="http://cheapbotsdonequick.com">Cheap Bots Done Quick</a> platform and are written in <a href="http://www.brightspiral.com/">Kate Compton's Tracery</a>, a tool for creating generative grammars. These include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/thetinygallery">The Tiny Gallery</a>: by far my most popular bot to date, the Tiny Gallery posts a few tiny exhibits each day, complete with equally tiny visitors. A <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/410496/emoji-becomes-art-in-tiny-gallery-on-twitter/">profile of the Tiny Gallery</a> was featured on tech and culture website Cult of Mac one day after its launch.</li>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/tiny_gardens">Tiny Gardens</a>: tiny computationally-generated emoji gardens.</li>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/tiny_cityscapes">Tiny Cityscapes</a>: emoji cities by day and night, each with its own micro-climate.</li>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/tiny_forests">Tiny Forests</a>: emoji forests, complete with wildlife. It has been featured in <a href="https://botzine.org/">The Bot! Zine</a>.</li>

					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/tinylittlehomes">Tiny Homes</a>: tiny ASCII/emoji houses and gardens.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>The second category of bots are either written in Python or Ruby, and run on cloud platform Heroku. They include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/owenpallettbot">Owen Pallett Lyrics</a>: Tweets randomly-selected lines from a corpus made up of the complete lyrics of <a href="http://owenpalletteternal.com">Owen Pallett</a> (formerly Final Fantasy).

One Small Bot has been featured in <a href="https://botzine.org/">The Bot! Zine</a>, and also placed third in their <a href="https://botwiki.org/monthly-bot-challenge/2016-january/#winners">space-themed January Monthly Bot Challenge</a>.
					</li>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/botlovesyou">Bot Loves You</a>: The first bot I ever created, Bot Loves You tweets emoji hearts a few times daily, and also responds to mentions. Despite its limited vocabulary and lack of intelligence, Bot Loves You is intended to make users feel fond of it, and holds semi-regular 'conversations' initiated by its followers.
