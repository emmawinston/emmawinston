			<i class="fa fa-music"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://deerful.band/album/city-bells">City Bells</a> (single) - 15th December 2015</strong>

			<p>A self-released festive single, written and recorded by me as <a href="https://deerful.com">Deerful</a>, and co-produced jointly between myself and Darren Hayman. I wanted to become more used to working with digital distributors and publicising my own work without the help of a label behind me, and also wanted to see if I could make my first publicly-available music project financially sustainable. </p>

			<p>The limited CD edition of the single sold out within 48 hours, more than covering its costs.The single was positively received by a number of small independent music bloggers, including <a href="http://fortherabbits.net/2015/12/10/premiere-deerful-city-bells/">For The Rabbits</a>, <a href="http://eardrumsmusic.com/2015/12/15/listen-to-deerfuls-lovely-and-festive-city-bells/">Eardrums Pop</a> and <a href="http://christmasunderground.com/2015/12/10/deerful-city-bells-2015/">Christmas Underground</a>, and was played by folk musician <a href="http://christt.com/">Chris T-T</a> on his late-night Brighton radio show, Midnight Campfire.

			<i class="fa fa-file-sound-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Ssa-ha-la - Cities and Memory: Dada Sounds</a> (sound art) - forthcoming</strong>

			<p>Cities and Memory is a global field recording &amp; sound art work that presents both the present reality of a place, but also its imagined, alternative counterpart â€“ remixing the world, one sound at at time. The Dada Sounds project marks a century of Dadaism by applying the techniques and practices of Dada to field recordings from around the world, bringing a Dadaist approach to the concepts of sound, place and memory.</p>

			<p>For my work, 'Ssa-ha-la', I chose to use an existing sound from the Cities and Memory database, since I felt this was more in keeping with the spirit of the Dada readymade than procuring my own field recording would have been (although I ultimately manipulated the recording far more than perhaps Marcel Duchamp would have approved of!). Listening closely to the sound of the waves and seagulls at low tide, I decided to write a sound poem, in the 'Bruitist' (or phonetic) form invented by Dadaist Richard Huelsenbeck, which would reflect and exaggerate the natural sounds accompanying it, replacing semantic logic with sonic logic. The result is a kind of 'sound song' which intertwines with the cries of the gulls and sibilant waves.</p>

			<i class="fa fa-file-sound-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://deerful.audio/sets/sound-journals">Sound Journals</a> (sound art collection) - ongoing</strong>

			<p>A series of short, semi-improvised sound artworks, constructed from found sounds recorded in specific places and spaces. The idea is both to capture the atmosphere of a given environment and to heavily manipulate it, so that it becomes almost more of an emotional document than a physical one.</p>
