			<i class="fa fa-music"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://deerful.band/album/city-bells">Deerful: City Bells</a> (single) - 15th December 2015</strong>

			<p>A self-released festive single, written and recorded by me as <a href="https://deerful.com">Deerful</a>, and co-produced jointly between myself and Darren Hayman. I wanted to become more used to working with digital distributors and publicising my own work without the help of a label behind me, and also wanted to see if I could make my first publicly-available music project financially sustainable. </p>

			<p>The limited CD edition of the single sold out within 48 hours, more than covering its costs.The single was positively received by a number of small independent music bloggers, including <a href="http://fortherabbits.net/2015/12/10/premiere-deerful-city-bells/">For The Rabbits</a>, <a href="http://eardrumsmusic.com/2015/12/15/listen-to-deerfuls-lovely-and-festive-city-bells/">Eardrums Pop</a> and <a href="http://christmasunderground.com/2015/12/10/deerful-city-bells-2015/">Christmas Underground</a>, and was played by folk musician <a href="http://christt.com/">Chris T-T</a> on his late-night Brighton radio show, Midnight Campfire.

			<i class="fa fa-file-sound-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://deerful.band/album/browser-pieces">Browser Pieces</a> (EP) - 26th January 2016</strong>

			<p>I engage with my web browser more than I do any other piece of electronic technology. I use it to consume research, to read, to listen to music, to view art. Until now, I had never used it to create.</p>

			<center><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4050612035/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=2ebd35/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://deerful.bandcamp.com/album/browser-pieces">Browser Pieces by Emma Winston</a></iframe></center>

			<p>Made in an evening, <i>Browser Pieces</i> challenges my own use of the web browser as a consumption device. Using five in-browser synths created by independent developers, I recorded four tracks ranging from soft ambience to multilayered minimalism using only Google Chrome and Audacity for live capture.</p>

			<i class="fa fa-file-sound-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Ssa-ha-la - Cities and Memory: Dada Sounds</a> (sound art) - forthcoming</strong>

			<p>Cities and Memory is a global field recording &amp; sound art work that presents both the present reality of a place, but also its imagined, alternative counterpart â€“ remixing the world, one sound at at time. The Dada Sounds project marks a century of Dadaism by applying the techniques and practices of Dada to field recordings from around the world, bringing a Dadaist approach to the concepts of sound, place and memory.</p>

			<p>For my work, 'Ssa-ha-la', I chose to use an existing sound from the Cities and Memory database, since I felt this was more in keeping with the spirit of the Dada readymade than procuring my own field recording would have been (although I ultimately manipulated the recording far more than perhaps Marcel Duchamp would have approved of!). Listening closely to the sound of the waves and seagulls at low tide, I decided to write a sound poem, in the 'Bruitist' (or phonetic) form invented by Dadaist Richard Huelsenbeck, which would reflect and exaggerate the natural sounds accompanying it, replacing semantic logic with sonic logic. The result is a kind of 'sound song' which intertwines with the cries of the gulls and sibilant waves.</p>

			<i class="fa fa-file-sound-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://deerful.audio/sets/sound-journals">Sound Journals</a> (sound art collection) - ongoing</strong>

			<p>A series of short, semi-improvised sound artworks, constructed from found sounds recorded in specific places and spaces. The idea is both to capture the atmosphere of a given environment and to heavily manipulate it, so that it becomes almost more of an emotional document than a physical one.</p>

			<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://twitter.com/graphicscorebot">Graphic Score Bot</a> - ongoing (<a href="https://emmawinston.me/graphicscorebot/">more about this</a>)</strong>

			<p>An art project using the Twitter platform to post hourly generative graphic scores. <a href="https://emmawinston.me/graphicscorebot/">More fully explained here</a>, the bot is designed as a jumping-off point rather than prescriptive or instructive, and generates score-like images (and occasional extracts from Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies) which can be interpreted by anyone, regardless of musical experience.</p>

			<p>Users are free to take into account or ignore everything from shape, colour, opacity, and position on 'stave' (or, occasionally, lack thereof) in their interpretations of what the bot posts. I plan to manually retweet any creations based on the generated scores that are sent to me.</p>

			<p>Graphic Score Bot is a superficial attempt to make sense of my own complicated feelings about sound art and experimental music, which I view as simultaneously more and less accessible to listeners and artists without a 'conventional' musical background. Despite the fact that experimental music can be played and created with no knowledge or understanding of Western art music whatsoever, the fact remains that the culture surrounding it is often intimidating. I wondered if I could take some of the self-consciousness out of composition by imposing limitations which are generated beyond my control, other than the parameters I feed into the bot in the first place (which I am well aware is another layer of complexity in play - although the meanings of these may equally change at the point of reception). Graphic Score Bot both limits the field of creativity and expands it infinitely, depending upon how it is interpreted.</p>

			<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://deerful.space">Twitter bots</a> - ongoing</strong>

			<p>A series of small bots, quickly made, using the Twitter platform to post automated humorous or artistic content. The bots fall into two categories; the first run on the <a href="http://cheapbotsdonequick.com">Cheap Bots Done Quick</a> platform and are written in <a href="http://www.brightspiral.com/">Kate Compton's Tracery</a>, a tool for creating generative grammars. These include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/tiny_gardens">Tiny Gardens</a>: tiny computationally-generated emoji gardens.</li>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/tiny_cityscapes">Tiny Cityscapes</a>: emoji cities by day and night, each with its own micro-climate.</li>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/tiny_forests">Tiny Forests</a>: emoji forests, complete with wildlife. It has been featured in <a href="https://botzine.org/">The Bot! Zine</a>.</li>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/bon_appetiny">Bon Appetiny</a>: tiny emoji dinners for two.
				</ul>

			<p>The second category of bots are either written in Python or Ruby, and run on cloud platform Heroku. They include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/one_small_bot">One Small Bot</a>: Selects random words from the dictionary and inserts them into Neil Armstrong's famous lunar landing speech. One Small Bot has been featured in <a href="https://botzine.org/">The Bot! Zine</a>.
					</li>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/botlovesyou">Bot Loves You</a>: The first bot I ever created, Bot Loves You tweets emoji hearts a few times daily, and also responds to mentions. Despite its limited vocabulary and lack of intelligence, Bot Loves You is intended to make users feel fond of it, and holds semi-regular 'conversations' initiated by its followers.
					</li>
					<li><a href="http://twitter.com/deerful_ebooks">Deerful Ebooks</a>: one of many bots inspired by Jason Bakkila's humorous years-long art project, Horse Ebooks, this bot repurposes tweets from my personal Twitter account to create a nonsensical simulacrum of me. This is an interactive bot which can hold conversations. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The bots are available in a stream at <a href="http://deerful.space">deerful.space</a> and can also be viewed at <a href="https://botwiki.org/tag/deer_ful/">BotWiki</a>.</p>
