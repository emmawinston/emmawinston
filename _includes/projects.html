			<i class="fa fa-file-sound-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://deerful.audio/sets/sound-journals">Sound Journals</a> (sound art collection) - ongoing</strong>

			<p>A series of short, semi-improvised sound artworks, constructed from found sounds recorded in specific places and spaces. The idea is both to capture the atmosphere of a given environment and to heavily manipulate it, so that it becomes almost more of an emotional document than a physical one.</p>

			<p>You can download or stream my sound journals <a href="http://deerful.audio/sets/sound-journals">here</a>.</p>

			<i class="fa fa-music"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://deerful.band/album/city-bells">City Bells</a> (single) - 15th December 2015</strong>

			<p>A self-released festive single, written and recorded by me as <a href="https://deerful.com">Deerful</a>, and co-produced jointly between myself and Darren Hayman. I wanted to become more used to working with digital distributors and publicising my own work without the help of a label behind me, and also wanted to see if I could make my first publicly-available music project financially sustainable. </p>

			<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4TA0K5U43A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

			<p>The single was positively received by a number of small independent music bloggers, including For The Rabbits, Eardrums Pop and Christmas Underground, and was played by folk musician Chris T-T on his late-night Brighton radio show.

			<i class="fa fa-gamepad"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://deerful.itch.io/cat-simulator-3000">Cat Simulator 3000</a> - 2nd December 2015</strong> 
			<p>A hypertext adventure game built in the <a href="http://twinery.org/">Twine engine</a>, Cat Simulator 3000 was built in a weekend and was as much a creative writing experiment as a coding one. You play a cat who has to wreak as much havoc in your owner's house as possible before they get home.</p>
