			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://deerful.band/album/city-bells">City Bells</a> - December 2015</strong>

			<p>A self-released festive single, written and recorded by me as <a href="https://deerful.com">Deerful</a>, and co-produced jointly between myself and Darren Hayman. I wanted to become more used to working with digital distributors and publicising my own work without the help of a label behind me, and also wanted to see if I could make my first publicly-available music project financially sustainable. </p>

			<p>The single was positively received by a number of small independent music bloggers, including For The Rabbits, Eardrums Pop and Christmas Underground, and was played by folk musician Chris T-T on his late-night Brighton radio show.

			<p>A hypertext adventure game built in the <a href="http://twinery.org/">Twine engine</a>, Cat Simulator 3000 was built in a weekend and was as much a creative writing experiment as a coding one. You play a cat who has to wreak as much havoc in your owner's house as possible before they get home.</p>
