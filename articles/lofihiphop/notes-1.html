            <h1>Lofi hip hop notes</h1>
<p>None of this is me proposing a direction to go in - mostly a brain-dump of the stuff that came up for me while reading. You can ignore all of it if it doesn’t interest you ;)</p>
<br>
<h2>Thoughts that didn’t fit anywhere else</h2>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/594b3z/how-lofi-hip-hop-radio-to-relaxstudy-to-became-a-youtube-phenomenon">Nostalgia for Adult Swim/Toonami</a>?? 
<ul><li>	I don’t know anything about either of these, what the soundtracks were like, etc - something to look into maybe. 
</li></ul></li><li>How does this relate to pirate radio?
</li><li>Giving people streams of music they didn’t know they would like? Scene adherents composing the mixes rather than being algorithmic as in streaming services
</li><li>YouTube will recommend channels to you but it can’t dictate <i>mixes</i> as it will for individual songs on YouTube Music
</li><li>But how formulaic is it? 
</li><li>Sort of a sense of differentiating yourself through sameness - which is quite conventional subcultural studies, isn’t it - homologies and codes, bricolage of Japanese and American culture, hip hop and jazz
</li><li>Is there some post-neoliberal melancholy stuff happening here?
</li></ul>
<br>
<h2>Generic conventions</h2>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LofiHipHop/comments/6ki1wy/on_the_subject_of_naming_your_beat/">Naming</a> - generic conventions that are tricky to pin down but here’s a lengthy discussion amongst producers
<ul><li>		 ‘“Lo-Fi” is pretty much one of those genres that’s probably the most honest it can be with it’s audience. We all came in this genre because we related to something. Usually it was sadness. Usually it was because it sounded cool. it could be a myriad of things but the main point people in here listen and create in the genre of “Lo-Fi” is because we’re being honest with ourself and with our audience. We’re not always happy, we feel alone, we’re scared, we’re confused, we want to relax from the stress that life gives. We just want life to be better, and people relate and understand this.’
</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krishrach/these-musicians-are-bringing-meaning-back-to-lo-fi">‘Broad, shapeless genre’</a> - looking at people pushing against the generic boundaries and attempting to use it to tell a story (how different are their works?)
</li><li>Facsimile of earlier recording technology - hip hop but using the recording technology of jazz
</li><li>(but almost everyone uses the same free Izotope plugin - <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/create-and-design/vinyl.html">Vinyl | Free Plug-in</a>)
</li></ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Post-neoliberal melancholy </h2>
<ul><li>Sadness as key - <a href="https://www.lukemcmanusmusic.org/message-board/2019/1/4/lo-fi-hip-hop-and-the-sadboi-culture">‘The generation that I’m a part of, what’s referred to as Generation Y or simply as millennials, is in the midst of an emotional crisis.’</a>
</li><li>Look at the comments of lofi mixes - not the live chat but the dump-and-run comments sections. Some of them are used almost as confessionals.
</li><li>Something about <i>resilience and melancholy</i> - withdrawing from the world as a way to fight back against expectations. 
</li><li>The word <i>anemoia</i> - nostalgia for a time you’ve never known - has spread across the internet. There are about 50,000 hits for it on Google. And it was coined /<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Existentialism/comments/9lewlb/anemoia/">six months ago on Reddit</a>/.
</li><li>‘Taps into the pervasive feeling that <i>any time must have been better than now</i>‘ <a href="https://dbknews.com/2018/11/09/lo-fi-hip-hop-video-radio-chill-beats-stream-compilation-meme/">A defense of lo-fi hip hop - The Diamondback</a>
</li><li>Sonic nostalgia but not contrived or self-aware like vaporwave?
<ul><li>	Grafton Tanner on vaporwave: ‘Perhaps we can think of it as digital melancholia, the feeling of never being full, of never encountering an end to the information stream, of never actually catching up with all that culture we feel we must keep up with in the first place. It is a lonely, exhausting burden unique to our moment in history. After all, you are still alone in your room even after checking Facebook, downloading a trove of music, and watching pornography. This bitter loneliness, one that gives the illusion of socializing on these social-media platforms, is a facet of this digital melancholia: we surf the web alone and binge on media alone.’ (Babbling Corpse: p55)
</li><li>	But Tanner suggests that vaporwave producers are deliberately ‘mocking and subverting’ the commodification of the past. (p60) I don’t think LFHH is doing that.
</li></ul></li><li>I’ve mentioned James and melancholy before:
<ul><li>	‘At the level of technique, melancholy is often more or less identical to resilience. melancholy takes the “turning-a-bug-into-a-feature” routine, but it applies it to material that can’t generate fully-functional features—that is, to the exception. So instead of producing dysfunction, as accelerationism does, melancholy produces suboptimal functionality , functionality that just doesn’t feel like it’s profitable enough.’ (Resilience and Melancholy: p20).
</li><li>	Look at the number of playlists of LFHH meant for getting high to. There are literally mixes called ’study high’. What is this if not suboptimal functionality? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6dIBkmmcO0">ＳＴＵＤＹ ＨＩＧＨ  lofi mixtape  - YouTube</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlnIkLw9es4">Smoke & Study | Chill Mix - YouTube</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/amuse.io/playlist/6ZUqG9zEynTVKBsgbvVikr ">HIGH AT WORK - Spotify playlist</a>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<br>
<h2>History</h2>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ablogsupreme/2013/02/07/171349007/why-j-dilla-may-be-jazzs-latest-great-innovator">J Dilla</a> - used an SP404 (I think?) and completely got rid of quantisation. Took sources from everywhere, kind of an archivist. Everything carefully chosen.
</li><li>His magnum opus <i>Donuts</i> was made from a hospital bed while he was dying and has been <a href="https://observer.com/2016/02/a-decade-old-still-fresh-how-j-dilla-wrote-the-future-with-donuts/">accordingly romanticised</a> 
</li><li>Nujabes - similarly died young. Japanese producer who soundtracked Samurai Champloo. Specifically focused on sampling jazz. 
</li><li>This might explain the Japanese connection, in part - interestingly I found a discussion where people were talking about pioneers, someone mentions Nujabes and the person says <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LofiHipHop/comments/9d27m1/discussion_who_would_you_consider_to_be_the/ ">‘I meant more recent producers’</a>. 
</li><li>Focus on the <i>imagined</i> past rather than the real one??
</li></ul>
<br>
<h2>Chill </h2>
<ul><li>Okay SO. I alluded to James and melancholy above but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/02/toned-down-for-what-how-chill-turned-toxic">I think I take a polar opposing view to her on lofi hiphop/chillhop</a>. 
<ul><li>	‘Chill also mimics the use of anti-anxiety medication to maintain productivity during anxiety-producing circumstances. When I searched for the term on Spotify, two of the top six playlist results were identified as music for studying (“ <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX8Uebhn9wzrS">Chill Lofi Study Beats</a> ” and “ <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/chillhopmusic/playlist/0CFuMybe6s77w6QQrJjW7d">Chillhop Study Beats</a> ”)’.
</li><li>	Except this is super selective - she is completely ignoring the ‘study/<b>relax</b>’ dichotomy. You could just as easily position this as deliberate slacking in the face of expectations (and honestly personally I do think there’s an element of that, especially if you look at how people who actually participate in it respond to it). 
</li></ul></li><li>Apparently James is doing a book on chill but hasn’t published anything outside of journalistic sources yet.
<ul><li>	Also: <a href="https://soundstudiesblog.com/2016/08/01/pops-chill-thrills-arent-so-cheap/">on chill and economic rationality</a>.
</li></ul></li><li>Honestly I feel like LFHH represents the polar opposite of what she’s talking about but she’s twisted it to fit her thesis, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. 
</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/matter/against-chill-930dfb60a577">Alana Massey</a> talks about the gendered nature of chill and says it’s the antithesis of warmth and earnestness. Women are expected to be chill as an antidote to hysteria.
<ul><li>	But if most of the participants in the LFHH channels are teenage boys what does that signify? 
</li><li>	Also, <i>is</i> it the antithesis of warmth? Look at the visuals. Everything is cosy. It feels linked to <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04933-1_12">hygge</a> to me.
</li></ul></li><li>How do gender and race factor into this? Are the kids who make up the audience mostly boys as I suspect they are? Are they mostly white as I suspect they are? Why do I suspect this? IDK. 
</li></ul>
